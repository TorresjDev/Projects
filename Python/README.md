## 📚 Learning Paths

### 1. freeCodeCamp Python Course
- **Chapters 1-8:**
  - 📝 Basics: Syntax, variables, data types
  - 🔄 Control structures: if/else, loops
  - 🛠️ Functions: Built-in & custom
  - 📜 Strings: Manipulation & methods
  - 📂 Files: Reading, writing, error handling
- **Exercises:**
  - Practice problems for each chapter
  - Real-world file parsing (e.g., `mbox.txt`)
- See [`freeCodeCamp/README.md`](freeCodeCamp/README.md) for a detailed breakdown.

### 2. LinkedIn Learning: Programming Foundations
- **Beyond the Fundamentals:**
  - 📋 Collections: Lists, dictionaries, mixed types
  - 🧩 Modules: Custom and standard imports
  - 📈 Data processing: File I/O, summing values
- **Hands-on Scripts:**
  - `beyond-fundamentals.py`: Advanced Python concepts
  - `add-values.py`: Reads numbers from a file, writes totals
  - `testmodule.py`: Simple multiplication function
  - Data files: `values.txt`, `values-totaled.txt`
