					It becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
					which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers
					of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of
					Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the
					opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which
					impel them to the separation.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
					are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
					unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
					of Happiness.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
					among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
					governed,
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive
					of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
					it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such
					principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
					seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
					established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
					accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed
					to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
					abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
					invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
					absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off
					such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies;
					and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
					former Systems of Government.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of the 46th President of the United States a
					history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
					object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To
					prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

					He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary
					for the public good.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation
					of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the
					right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to
					them and formidable to tyrants only.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; He has called together legislative bodies at places
					unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their
					public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance
					with his measures.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for
					opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the
					people.

					&nbsp; &nbsp; He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,
					to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers,
					incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for
					their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all
					the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these
					States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of
					Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations
					hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by
					refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the
					tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
