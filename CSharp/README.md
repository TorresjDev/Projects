# My C# Learning Journey 🚀🧑‍💻

Welcome to my C# Learning Journey repository! This space is dedicated to my progress and explorations as I delve into the world of C# through a structured course with Microsoft. Here, you'll find various programs that demonstrate basic to intermediate C# programming concepts within a neatly organized folder structure.

## Folder Structure 🗂️

#### Introduction Folder 🌟

All introductory projects and examples can be found within the `Introduction` folder. This includes:

- **Basic Operations**
- **DataTypes**
- **MyConsoleApp**
- **String**
- **Variables**

Each sub-folder contains a `Program.cs` that showcases specific concepts ranging from simple data types to complex conditional structures.

#### Project Folders 💽

Other major projects are organized into their own folders:

- **[CalculateGPA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/guided-project-calculate-final-gpa/)**
  - **Description**: A console application to calculate the GPA based on predefined grades.
  - **Key Concepts**: Conditional logic, variables, console I/O.
  - **Path**: `/CalculateGPA/Program.cs`
- **[Student Grades](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/guided-project-calculate-print-student-grades/)**
  - **Description**: Automates the calculation of student grades based on assignment scores.
  - **Key Concepts**: Arrays, loops, complex calculations.
  - **Path**: `/Student Grades/Program.cs`

## Setup and Running the Repo 🔧

To run any of these projects, clone the repo and navigate to the project directory in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csharp-learning-journey.git
cd csharp-learning-journey/ProjectFolder
dotnet run
```

## Learning Resources 📚

This repository is based on the learning path I followed from Microsoft's official training platform. The course provides an excellent foundation for C# programming, covering everything from basic syntax to more complex operations.

### Course Details:

- **Title**: Get Started with C#
- **Provider**: Microsoft Learn
- **Course Link**: [Get Started with C# - Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-c-sharp-part-1/)
- **Description**: This course introduces the fundamental concepts of C# programming including data types, operations, and writing simple code. It's designed for beginners and provides interactive exercises to reinforce learning.

For more detailed projects and examples that build on these basics, see the [Guided Project: Calculate Final GPA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/guided-project-calculate-final-gpa/) and other modules available in the course.

Feel free to explore the learning path and enhance your understanding of C# to build more complex applications!
